FPGA Glitcher
=============

Target is a TinyFPGA BX

PicoSOC running the glitcher.v hardware block which generates an output pulse of variable delay and duration
based on a trigger signal (edge triggered). Configuration is via the serial port of the FPGA.
This should allow for automated testing of glitch parameters (delay, duration) against a target until for example
successfull JTAG access is possible.

TODO: proper serial protocol for the FPGA
